Compressive spectral imaging (CSI) captures coded and dispersed projections of the spatio-spectral source rather than direct measurements of the voxels. Using the coded projections, an l1 minimization reconstruction algorithm is then used to reconstruct the underlying scene. An architecture known as the snapshot colored compressive spectral imager (SCCSI) exploits the compression capabilities of CSI techniques and efficiently senses a spectral image using a single snapshot by means of a colored mosaic FPA detector and a dispersive element. In CSI, different coding patterns are used to acquire multiple snapshots, yielding improved reconstructions of spatially detailed and spectrally rich scenes. SCCSI however, does not admit multiple coding patterns since the pixelated tiling of optical filters is directly attached to the detector. This paper extends the concept of SCCSI to a system admitting multiple measurement shots by rotating the dispersive element such that the dispersed spatio-spectral source is coded and integrated at different detector pixels in each rotation. This approach allows the acquisition of a different set of coded projections on each measurement shot. Simulations show that increasing the number of measurement snapshots results on improved reconstructions. More specifically, a gain up to 7 dB is obtained when results from four measurement shots are compared to the reconstruction from a single SCCSI snapshot.
