<li> Determine the pixels distribution in a coded aperture, responsible for the saturation of a multispectral sensor, and examine how these saturated compressed measurements affect the reconstruction of the multispectral scene. </li>
<li> Identify the pixels of the encoded aperture, responsible for the saturation in each of the sensor pixels, used by analyzing the mathematical model of a compressive acquisition system of multispectral images. </li>
<li> Design and implement an adaptive computational algorithm capable of generating coded openings in gray scale in order to reduce the saturation in the sensor of a compressive acquisition system of multispectral images. </li>
<li> Validate by computer simulation the openings encoded in gray scale generated by the algorithm developed, in order to analyze its impact on the dynamic range of multispectral image reconstructions. </li>
<li> Disseminate the results of the research developed through the preparation of a publishable article that exposes the problem addressed and the algorithm developed to solve it. </li>
