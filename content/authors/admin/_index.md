I'm Carlos Hinojosa. Computer scientist and engineer with over 6 years of experience in software development and scientific research. I received the B. Sc. and M. Sc. degrees in Computer Science from Universidad Industrial de Santander, Colombia, in 2015 and 2018, respectively. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. in computer science at Universidad Industrial de Santander. My main research areas are computational imaging, optical code design, compressive imaging, computer vision and sparse representation. I also have developed scientific software for companies like Ecopetrol-ICP and for my university in different research projects. I have experience with different programming languages like C/C++, Java, C#, Javascript, MATLAB, Typescript, Python and Bash scripting in Linux-like operating systems. Furthermore, I have experience with Linux system administration and hybrid mobile app development with different frameworks like Ionic, React and Cordova.
